				<p class="lead">The Joint Weather and Climate Research Programme (JWCRP) facilitates research between the Met Office and NERC. Its overarching goal is to ensure the UK maintains and strengthens its leading international position in weather and climate science.</p>
				<p>The JWCRP has two major elements. The first is a joint commitment to sustaining and growing the UK's national capability in observing, understanding, modelling and predicting weather and climate, along with the infrastructure required to deliver that national capability. The second is to align major research initiatives and programmes to ensure the most effective impact of the research and pull-through into the delivery of services to government and business.</p>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 40px;">The JWCRP allows the Met Office and  NERC to speak with one voice on issues around major infrastructure investments, and enables both organisations to demonstrate efficient use of resources.<p>
